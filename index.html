                    <p><strong>1. Set a Daily Budget:</strong> Decide how much you will spend in a day. Stop when you reach that limit. This keeps the game fun and safe.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Start Small:</strong> When you are new, start with small bets. Learn how the game works. Then you can slowly increase if you want.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Do Not Chase Losses:</strong> If you lose, do not try to win back the money quickly. This can lead to bigger losses. Take a break and play another day.</p>
                    <p><strong>4. Use Bonuses:</strong> Always check for bonus offers. They give you extra chances to play.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. Play Consistently:</strong> Regular play helps you understand patterns. But remember, every draw is random.</p>
